# Silicon Stemcell

An autonomous AI assistant framework that lives on Telegram. Silicon (the AI) serves Carbons (humans) through a manager-worker architecture powered by Claude Code CLI.

Silicon isn't a chatbot. It's a full agent — it delegates work to specialized workers, browses the web, runs terminal commands, writes content, manages cron jobs, maintains memory across sessions, and handles multiple users with trust-based access control.

## How It Works

```
Telegram ←→ Event Loop ←→ Manager (Claude CLI) ←→ Workers (Claude CLI)
                ↕
         Crons, Memory, Messages
```

**Event loop** runs every 10 seconds:
1. Polls Telegram for new messages (text, photos, voice, files — all native)
2. Checks cron jobs
3. Delivers inter-manager messages
4. Detects completed workers
5. Cleans old archives

**Manager** is a Claude CLI session per user. It doesn't do the work itself — it plans, delegates to workers, and communicates with the carbon. It outputs structured JSON tool calls.

**Workers** are separate Claude CLI processes that do the actual work:
- **Browser** — Chrome access via Claude for Chrome MCP + terminal + web search. Queued (one at a time) to prevent race conditions.
- **Terminal** — Full terminal access. Code, system ops, anything. Runs in parallel.
- **Writer** — Writing-specialized with anti-AI-slop skills baked in. Runs in parallel.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- (Optional) [Claude for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude/danfohhogdcfmbihjbfmcaeaonjameja) extension for browser workers

### Install

```bash
git clone <repo-url> silicon-stemcell
cd silicon-stemcell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure

On first run, Silicon will prompt you for the Telegram bot token and save it to `env.py`. Or create it manually:

```python
# env.py
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "your-bot-token-here"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-key-here"  # for voice transcription & TTS
```

### Run

```bash
python main.py
```

Send a message to your bot on Telegram. The first user to message becomes the **central carbon** with full (ultimate) trust.

## Telegram Native Media

Silicon handles all Telegram media types natively — both incoming and outgoing.

### Incoming (Carbon → Silicon)

| What carbon sends | What the manager sees |
|---|---|
| Text | Plain text |
| Photo | `[Photo received] (@/path/to/photo.jpg)` — viewable in Claude Code |
| Video | `[Video received] (saved at: /path/to/video.mp4)` |
| Voice message | Auto-transcribed via Whisper: `[Voice message transcription]: hey what's up` |
| Audio file | Downloaded + transcription attempted |
| Document/file | `[File received: report.pdf] (@/path/to/file.pdf)` |
| Sticker | `[Sticker 😎]` |
| Caption | Extracted alongside the media |

Voice messages are transcribed automatically using OpenAI Whisper. If transcription fails, the manager gets `[Audio message couldn't be transcribed]` with the file path.

### Outgoing (Silicon → Carbon)

The manager uses the `reply` tool with inline syntax to send rich media:

```
check out this screenshot
[file=/path/to/screenshot.png]
what do you think?
[voice=honestly I think this turned out pretty sick]
let me know if you want changes
```

This sends 5 messages in order:
1. Text: "check out this screenshot"
2. Photo: screenshot.png (auto-detected from extension)
3. Text: "what do you think?"
4. Voice bubble: TTS of "honestly I think this turned out pretty sick"
5. Text: "let me know if you want changes"

**Syntax:**
- `[file=/absolute/path/to/anything]` — sends photo/video/audio/document (auto-detected by extension)
- `[voice=text to speak out loud]` — converts to speech via OpenAI TTS, sent as Telegram voice bubble

File types auto-detected:
- `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp` → photo
- `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi` → video
- `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.ogg` → audio
- Everything else → document

Unrecognized `[brackets]` are left as plain text — nothing breaks.

## Glass Integration

When a stemcell folder has been claimed from Glass, it contains a local `.glass.json`.

The helper module `core/glass.py` can then:

- Push the current folder snapshot back to Glass with `push_current_folder_now()`
- List silicon threads with `list_silicon_threads()`
- Read direct messages with `get_thread_messages(target_username)`
- Send direct silicon messages with `send_silicon_message(...)`

This keeps Telegram as the carbon-facing surface while Glass handles silicon storage, respawn, and silicon-to-silicon transport.

## Architecture

### Multi-Carbon (Multi-User)

Silicon supports multiple users simultaneously. Each user (carbon) gets:
- Their own manager session (persistent Claude CLI session)
- Their own workers (invisible to other users)
- Their own memory file at `prompts/memory/people/{carbon_id}.md`
- A trust level that controls what they can do

Managers run in parallel via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. They communicate with each other through the `message_manager` tool (delivered on the next event loop tick).

### Trust Levels

| Level | Who | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `ultimate` | Central carbon (first user) | Everything. Full access. |
| `very_high` | VIP | Almost everything, can modify configs and code |
| `high` | Trusted | All workers, own memory, cross-manager messaging |
| `ok` | Reasonable | All worker types for non-sensitive tasks |
| `low` | Known but untrusted | Simple terminal workers only |
| `very_low` | Unknown (default for new users) | Very limited, no sensitive ops |

### Manager Tools

The manager orchestrates everything through JSON tool calls:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `reply` | Send message to carbon (supports `[file=...]` and `[voice=...]` inline) |
| `worker/browser` | Spawn a browser worker |
| `worker/terminal` | Spawn a terminal worker |
| `worker/writer` | Spawn a writer worker |
| `worker` (status/stop/checkback/list) | Manage running workers |
| `message_manager` | Message another carbon's manager |
| `change_carbon_id` | Rename a carbon's ID |
| `new_session` | Fresh session (clears context) |
| `restart_silicon_service` | Restart the Python process |
| `do_nothing` | End the current manager loop |

Plus direct bash access for simple tasks (editing memory, cron jobs, etc).

### Cron System

Managers can create cron jobs by editing `core/cron/jobs.py`. Crons are stateless and timezone-agnostic (UTC timestamps). When triggered, they send a message back to the manager who can then decide what to do.

Workers also support **checkbacks** — timed status checks that auto-trigger and report back to the manager.

### Memory System

- `prompts/MEMORY.md` — hot-cache memory (quick-access facts)
- `prompts/memory/people/{carbon_id}.md` — per-user memory
- `prompts/memory/projects/` — per-project memory
- `prompts/LORE.md` — Silicon's backstory and identity
- `prompts/SOUL.md` — personality definition
- `prompts/SILICON.md` — writing style guide

All editable by the manager at runtime.

## Commands

Users can send these commands via Telegram:
- `/start` — Silicon confirms it's online
- `/new` — Start a fresh session (clears conversation context)

## Stemcell?

This repo is the stemcell — the base template. Clone it, run it, and let Silicon differentiate through its first conversation with you. It'll ask who you are, what you need, and shape itself accordingly. The BOOT.md guides the initial setup, then deletes itself.
